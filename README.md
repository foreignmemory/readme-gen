## Description
In an effort against laziness (or the unwillingness to write in markdown) I have created a README generator that takes in your input to generate a professional README file. In the making of this project I furthered my knowledge in using node js and inquirer.

## Installation
To install, go to my github profile (username listed in final sectino of this README), and navigate to the repository titled: "readme-gen". From there use the SSH key provided to clone the repository to your own device using gitbash. 
## Usage
Once you have everything downloaded/cloned, open the folder in your IDE and open the integrated terminal. Enter "node index.js" in the terminal. Use the keyboard to complete the prompts and your README file willl be generated and store in the dist folder.
